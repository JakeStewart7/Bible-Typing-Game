# Bible-Typing-Game
A typing game for the Bible.

Development conventions are documented in [`docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`](docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md).

## Multiplayer foundation

The **Together** workspace runs a complete multiplayer loop against a local mock
authority. Create a room, add simulated players, and exercise synchronized
typing, shared passage guesses, scoring, and ready-up without deploying a
backend.

Multiplayer code is isolated under `src/multiplayer/`:

- `domain/` owns room states, commands, phase transitions, and scoring.
- `infrastructure/` supplies passages and the in-memory mock transport.
- `ui/` renders snapshots and sends player intentions.

All game modes share the input processing and typing presentation primitives in
`src/typing/session.ts`, including correctness tracking, live statistics,
character states, progress, and caret behavior.

Mock rooms support host-managed bots with independent Easy, Normal, or Hard
typing profiles. Passage lengths are absolute character ceilings (60, 120, 250,
500, or 1,000 characters), so a passage may end partway through its final verse.
The reference still includes that verse. Guessing lasts 30 seconds and submits
each player's latest draft when the deadline expires.

The UI depends on the `MultiplayerClient` and `RoomConnection` contracts in
`domain/types.ts`. A future WebSocket or WebRTC implementation should implement
those contracts and leave the room UI and gameplay rules unchanged. In a
production deployment, execute `RoomEngine` on the authoritative host or server
and validate serialized commands before dispatching them.
